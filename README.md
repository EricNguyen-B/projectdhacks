Our project for DragonHacks 2020 is Traffix. 

We developed an algorithm and built a physical simulator in arduino to efficiently change traffic signals. For a lot of the traffic lights in the United States, there are set amount of times for light switches based upon pre-existing data. Our plan to relieve conjestion in local street insection is to decrease the time between light switches dependent upon the amount of vechicles that accrue over a set amount of time. In our model, we used an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor arduino attachment to sense the distance between the model traffic light and car. Rather than completely switching the light to the lane with the most concentration of cars, it favors that lane slightly more in our score system to determine when the light switches. The higher the score, the higher the priority the lane has with our traffic light algorithm.
